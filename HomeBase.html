  <h1> ABOUT ME </h1>
<p> I was born and raised in Philladelphia, Pennsylvania. My birthday is June 20th 2000. In total i have eight siblins, four brothers and three sisters from my dad side, a brother from my mom side, and a step sister from my step dads side and yet im still stuck in the middle. The oldest of us is Dauri hes 21 then, Darwin hes 20 years old then, its Daniel hes 19 years old then, its my step sister Cristina shes 21 years old then, my sister Anshelly shes 18 years old then, me im 17 years old then, my brother Christopher hes 13 years old then, my little sister Darlenie shes 4 years old and finally, my baby sister Diana shes only 3 months old. I never considered Cristina as my step sister ive considered her as my second mom.Ive only taveled to two places in my entire life, ive traveled to Dominican Republic and Atlanta, Georgia. My future goal is to become a doctor, ive always liked helping people and making them feel better thats why i think a doctor would best suit me. I decited i wanted to become a doctor my freshman year of High school but i wasnt 100% sure till the beginign of my junior year, my baby cousin is the one who made me relise imwanted to become a doctor. Hes 5 years old and when i see him hurt it breaks my heart and his love for me its beyond anything and thats why i want to become a doctor especially for kids because it hurts me when they are hurt so i wanna be able to make them happy so they can forget about the pain they have.  </p>
<p> I love playing sports especially softball but I have patella femoral syndrome, if you dont know what that is, its a condition when the cartilage under the kneecap is damaged due to injury or overuse. Its most commond on teenagers my age especially athletes. Summer 2017 i attended a program in Atlanta, Georgia called Girls Who Code and that is how i learned how to code and build my own portfolio. At Girls Who Code we learn a bunch of cool stuff like python, we also got to use this cool coding website called scratch. </p>
