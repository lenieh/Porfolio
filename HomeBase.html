In total I have eight siblins, four brothers and three sisters from my dad side, a brother from my mom side, and a step sister from my step dads side and yet im still stuck in the middle. The oldest of us is Dauri hes 21 then, Darwin hes 20 years old then, its Daniel hes 19 years old then, its my step sister Cristina shes 21 years old then, my sister Anshelly shes 18 years old then, me im 17 years old then, my brother Christopher hes 13 years old then, my little sister Darlenie shes 4 years old and finally, my baby sister Diana shes only 3 months old. I never considered Cristina as my step sister ive considered her as my second mom.Ive only taveled to two places in my entire life, ive traveled to Dominican Republic and Atlanta, Georgia.  </p>
<p> I love playing sports especially softball but I have patella femoral syndrome, if you dont know what that is, its a condition when the cartilage under the kneecap is damaged due to injury or overuse. Its most commond on teenagers my age especially athletes. Summer 2017 i attended a program in Atlanta, Georgia called Girls Who Code and that is how i learned how to code and build my own portfolio. At Girls Who Code we learn a bunch of cool stuff like python, we also got to use this cool coding website called scratch. </p>
  <p> A little bit more about me, im a aunt to two beautiful girls, a one year old name Lillienne and a two month old named Brigh and man i love those girls with all my heart they truely make me happy. Im a senior at Olney Charter High School graduating class of 2018. My future goal is to become a doctor, ive always liked helping people and making them feel better thats why i thinka doctor would best suit me. I decited to become a doctor my freashman year of high school but i wasnt 100% sure until the end of my sophmore year, my baby cousin is the one who made me realize i wanted to become a doctor. Hes 5 years old amd when i see him hurt it breaks my heart and his love for me it beyond anything and thats why i want to become a doctor especially for kids because it hurts me when they are hurt so i wanna be able to make them happy so they can forget about the pain and also help them in anyway i can. </p>
